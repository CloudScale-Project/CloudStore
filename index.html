        <h1>Showcase</h1>
        <h2>For showcasing the utility of the CloudScale Environment tools and the CloudScale Method, we decided to create a fictitious company with an application that we will drive from a mock-up state to a fully scalable and cost-effective version using the CloudScale project results as tools to achieve this goal easily and efficiently. To that end we took the existing TPC-W definition of an electronic commerce composed of a detailed requirements definitions as well as benchmarking metrics, and which has a legacy monolithic implementation. The progress of the implementation will be divided into three incremental phases. Phase 0 is the legacy system, Phase 1 a modernized version using current technologies for scalability, Phase 2 will provide with a fully and elastically scalable implementation, and the Phase 3 will be focused in the reduction of the operational costs of the entire system. For a full description of the requirements evolution see the Scalability Storyline.</h2>
