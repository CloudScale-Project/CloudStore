<H1>gd 1.7.2</H1>
<H2>A graphics library for fast image creation</H2>
<H2>Follow this link to the
<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">latest version
of this document</A>.</H2>
<blockquote>
<strong>HEY! READ THIS!</strong>
gd 1.7.2 creates PNG images, not GIF images. This is a good thing.
PNG is a more compact format, and full compression is available.
Existing code will need modification to call gdImagePng instead
of gdImageGif. <strong>Please do not ask us to send you the old GIF
version of GD.</strong> Unisys holds a patent on the LZW compression
algorithm, which is used in fully compressed GIF images. We are
still investigating the legal issues surrounding various
alternative means of producing a valid GIF file.
<p>
gd 1.7.2 <strong>requires</strong> that the following libraries 
also be installed:
<p>
libpng
<p>
zlib
<p>
If you want to use the TrueType font support, you must also
install the <strong>Freetype library</strong>, including
the <strong><code>freetype.h</code> header file</strong>.
See the <a href="http://www.freetype.org/">Freetype Home Page</a>.
No, I cannot explain why that site is down on a particular day,
and no, I can't send you a copy.
<p>
If you want to use the Xpm color bitmap loading support, you must also
have the X Window System and the Xpm library installed (Xpm is often
included in modern X distributions).
<p>
Please read the documentation and install the required libraries.
Do not send email asking why <code>png.h</code> is not found. 
See the <a href="#required">requirements section</a> for more
information. Thank you!

<A NAME="whatis"><H3>What is gd?</H3></A>
<P>
gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly
draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple
colors, cut and paste from other images, and flood fills, and
write out the result as a .PNG file. This is particularly
useful in World Wide Web applications, where .PNG is one
of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.
<P>
gd is not a paint program.
If you are looking for a paint program, you are looking in
the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are looking
in the wrong place.
<P>
gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics
operation. It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become
a kitchen-sink graphics package, but version 1.7.2 incorporates
most of the commonly requested features for an 8-bit 2D package.
Support for truecolor images, JPEG and 
truecolor PNG is planned for version 2.0.
<P>
<A NAME="gdother"><H3>What if I want to use another programming
language?</h3></A>
<h4>Perl</h4>
gd can also be used from Perl, courtesy of
Lincoln Stein's
<a href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/GD.html">
GD.pm</a> library, which uses gd as the basis for a set of
Perl 5.x classes. Updated to gd 1.6 and up.
<h4>Tcl</h4>
gd can be used from Tcl with John Ellson's
<a href=http://www.tcltk.com/ftp/ellson/>Gdtclft</a>
dynamically loaded extension package.
(Gdtclft2.0 or later is needed for gd-1.6 and up with PNG output.)
<h4>Any Language</h4>
There are, at the moment, at least three simple interpreters that
perform gd operations. You can output the desired commands to a simple
text file from whatever scripting language you prefer to use, then
invoke the interpreter.
<p>
These packages have not been updated to gd 1.6 and up as of this writing.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7.2"><H3>What's new in version 1.7.2?</H3></A>
An uninitialized-pointer bug in <code>gdtestttf.c</code> was corrected.
This bug caused crashes at the end of each call to gdImageStringTTF on
some platforms. Thanks to Wolfgang Haefelinger.
<p>
Documentation fixes. Thanks to Dohn Arms.
<p>
Makefile fixes to permit
linking with all libraries required on platforms with order-
dependent linkers.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.7.1?</H3></A>
A minor buglet in the Makefile was corrected, as well as an inaccurate
error message in <code>gdtestttf.c</code>. Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.7"><H3>What's new in version 1.7?</H3></A>
Version 1.7 contains the following changes:
<ul>
<li>Japanese language support for the TrueType functions.
Thanks to Masahito Yamaga.
<li><code>autoconf</code> and <code>configure</code> have been removed, in favor of a 
carefully designed Makefile which produces and properly installs
the library and the binaries. System-dependent variables are
at the top of the Makefile for easy modification. I'm sorry, 
folks, but autoconf generated <strong>many, many confused email 
messages</strong> from people who didn't have things where autoconf 
expected to find them. I am not an autoconf/automake wizard, and 
gd is a simple, very compact library which does not need to 
be a shared library. I <strong>did</strong> make many improvements
over the old gd 1.3 Makefile, which were directly inspired by the 
autoconf version found in the 1.6 series (thanks to John Ellson).
<li>Completely ANSI C compliant, according to the <code>-pedantic-errors</code>
flag of gcc. Several pieces of not-quite-ANSI-C code were causing problems
for those with non-gcc compilers.
<li><code>gdttf.c</code> patched to allow the use of Windows symbol
fonts, when present (thanks to Joseph Peppin). 
<li><code>extern "C"</code> wrappers added to <code>gd.h</code> and the
font header files for the convenience of C++ programmers. 
<code>bdftogd</code> was also modified to automatically insert these
wrappers into future font header files. Thanks to John Lindal.
<li>Compiles correctly on platforms that don't define <code>SEEK_SET</code>.
Thanks to Robert Bonomi.
<li>Loads Xpm images via the 
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromXpm"><code>gdImageCreateFromXpm</code></a>
function, if the Xpm library is available. Thanks to Caolan McNamara.
</ul>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.3?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.3 corrects a memory leak in gd_png.c. This leak caused
a significant amount of memory to be allocated and not freed when
writing a PNG image. 
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.2"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.2?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.2 from John Ellson <ellson@lucent.com> adds two new functions:
<ul>
<li>gdImageStringTTF - scalable, rotatable, anti-aliased, TrueType strings using
the FreeType library, but only if libttf is found by configure.
<strong>We do not provide TrueType fonts. Obtaining them
is entirely up to you.</strong>
<li>gdImageColorResolve - an efficient alternative for the
common code fragment:
<pre>

      if ((color=gdImageColorExact(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
          if ((color=gdImageColorAllocate(im,R,G,B)) < 0)
              color=gdImageColorClosest(im,R,G,B);
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Also in this release the build process has been converted to
GNU autoconf/automake/libtool conventions so that both (or either)
static and shared libraries can be built.
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6.1"><H3>What's new in version 1.6.1?</H3></A>
Version 1.6.1 incorporates superior PNG reading and writing code
from Greg Roelofs, with minor modifications by Tom Boutell. 
Specifically, I altered his code to read non-palette images
(converting them to palette images badly, by dithering them),
and to tolerate palette images with types of transparency that
gd doesn't actually support (it just ignores the advanced
transparency features). Any bugs in this area are therefore my 
fault, not Greg's.
<p>
Unlike gd 1.6, users should have no trouble linking with
gd 1.6.1 if they follow the instructions and install all of
the pieces. However, <strong>If you get undefined symbol errors,
be sure to check for older versions of libpng in your
library directories!</strong>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.6"><H3>What's new in version 1.6?</H3></A>
Version 1.6 features the following changes:
<p>
<strong>Support for 8-bit palette PNG images has been added.
Support for GIF has been removed.</strong> This step was taken
to completely avoid the legal controversy regarding the LZW
compression algorithm used in GIF. Unisys holds a patent which
is relevant to LZW compression. PNG is a superior image format
in any case. Now that PNG is supported by both Microsoft
Internet Explorer and Netscape (in their recent releases),
we highly recommend that GD users upgrade in order to get 
well-compressed images in a format which is legally unemcumbered.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.5"><H3>What's new in version 1.5?</H3></A>

Version 1.5 featured the following changes:

<dl>
<dt><b>New GD2 format</b>
<dd>      An improvement over the GD format, the GD2 format uses the zlib
          compression library to compress the image in chunks. This results
          in file sizes comparable to GIFs, with the ability to access parts
          of large images without having to read the entire image into memory.
<p>
	This format also supports version numbers and rudimentary validity
	checks, so it should be more 'supportable' than the previous GD format.
<p>
<dt><b>Re-arranged source files</b>
<dd>      gd.c has been broken into constituant parts: io, gif, gd, gd2 and
          graphics functions are now in separate files.
<p>
<dt><b>Extended I/O capabilities.</b>
<dd>      The source/sink feature has been extended to support GD2 file formats (which
          require seek/tell functions), and to allow more general non-file I/O.
<p>
<dt><b>Better support for Lincoln Stein's Perl Module</b>
<dd>      The new gdImage*Ptr function returns the chosen format stored in a block of memory.
          This can be directly used by the GD perl module.
<p>
<dt><b>Added functions</b>
<dd>gdImageCreateFromGd2Part - allows retrieval of part of an image (good for huge images, like maps),
<br>gdImagePaletteCopy - Copies a palette from one image to another, doing it's best to match the colors in the target image to the colors in the source palette.
<br>gdImageGd2, gdImageCreateFromGd2 - Support for new format
<br>gdImageCopyMerge - Merges two images (useful to highlight part of an image)
<br>gdImageCopyMergeGray - Similar to gdImageCopyMerge, but tries to preserve source image hue.
<br>gdImagePngPtr, gdImageGdPtr, gdImageGd2Ptr - return memort blocks for each type of image.
<br>gdImageCreateFromPngCtx, gdImageCreateFromGdCtx, gdImageCreateFromGd2Ctx, gdImageCreateFromGd2PartCtx - Support for new I/O context.

</dl>

<b>NOTE:</b> In fairness to Thomas Boutell, any bug/problems with any of the above features should
probably be reported to <a href=mailto:pjw@rhyme.com.au>Philip Warner</a>.

<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.4"><H3>What's new in version 1.4?</H3></A>

Version 1.4 features the following changes:
<dl>
<dt>Fixed polygon fill routine (again)
<dd>Thanks to Kirsten Schulz, version 1.4 is able to fill
numerous types of polygons that caused problems with
previous releases, including version 1.3.
<dt>Support for alternate data sources
<dd>Programmers who wish to load a GIF from something other
than a stdio FILE * stream can use the new
<a href="#gdImageCreateFromPngSource">gdImageCreateFromPngSource</a> function.
<dt>Support for alternate data destinations
<dd>Programmers who wish to write a GIF to something other
than a stdio FILE * stream can use the new
<a href="#gdImagePngToSink">gdImagePngToSink</a> function.
<dt>More tolerant when reading GIFs
<dd>
Version 1.4 does not crash when reading certain animated GIFs,
although it still only reads the first frame. Version 1.4 also has
overflow testing code to prevent crashes when reading
damaged GIFs.
</dl>
<P><A NAME="whatsnew1.3"><H3>What's new in version 1.3?</H3></A>
Version 1.3 features the following changes:
<dl>
<dt>Non-LZW-based GIF compression code
<dd>
Version 1.3 contained GIF compression code that uses simple Run Length
Encoding instead of LZW compression, while still retaining compatibility
with normal LZW-based GIF decoders (your browser will still like your GIFs).
<strong>LZW compression is patented by Unisys. We are currently reevaluating
the approach taken by gd 1.3. The current release of gd does not support
this approach. We recommend that you use the current release, and generate
PNG images.</strong> Thanks to 
Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation for contributing
the RLE GIF code.
<dt>8-bit fonts, and 8-bit font support
<dd>This improves support for European languages. Thanks are due
to Honza Pazdziora <adelton@informatics.muni.cz> and also to
Jan Pazdziora <adelton@fi.muni.cz>. Also see the provided bdftogd
Perl script if you wish to convert fixed-width X11 fonts
to gd fonts.
<dt>16-bit font support (no fonts provided)
<dd>Although no such fonts are provided in the distribution,
fonts containing more than 256 characters should work if the
gdImageString16 and gdImageStringUp16 routines are used.
<dt>Improvements to the "webpng" example/utility
<dd>The "webpng" utility is now a slightly more useful application. Thanks to
Brian Dowling for this code.
<dt>Corrections to the color resolution field of GIF output
<dd>Thanks to Bruno Aureli.
<dt>Fixed polygon fills
<dd>A one-line patch for the infamous polygon fill bug, courtesy
of Jim Mason. I believe this fix is sufficient. However, if you
find a situation where polygon fills still fail to behave properly,
please send code that demonstrates the problem, <em>and</em> a fix if
you have one. Verifying the fix is important.
<dt>Row-major, not column-major
<dd>Internally, gd now represents the array of pixels as
an array of rows of pixels, rather than an array of columns
of pixels. This improves the performance of compression and
decompression routines slightly, because horizontally adjacent
pixels are now next to each other in memory. <strong>This should
not affect properly written gd applications, but applications that
directly manipulate the <code>pixels</code> array will require
changes.</strong>
</dl>
<A NAME="required"><H3>What else do I need to use gd?</H3></A>
<P>
To use gd, you will need an ANSI C compiler. <strong>All popular
Windows 95 and NT C compilers are ANSI C compliant.</strong> Any
full-ANSI-standard C compiler should be adequate. <strong>The cc
compiler released with SunOS 4.1.3 is not an ANSI C compiler.
Most Unix users who do not already have gcc should get it.
gcc is free, ANSI compliant and a de facto industry standard.
Ask your ISP why it is missing.</strong>
<P>
As of version 1.6, you also need the zlib compression library,
and the libpng library. As of version 1.6.2, you can draw text
using antialiased TrueType fonts if you also have the libttf
library installed, but this is not mandatory.
zlib is available for a variety of platforms from
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/">the zlib web site</a>.
libpng is available for a variety of platforms from
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/">the PNG web site</a>.

<P>
You will also want a PNG viewer, if you do not already have
one for your system, since you will need a good way to check the
results of your work. Netscape 4.04 and higher, and Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher, both support PNG.
For some purposes you might be happier with a package like 
Lview Pro for Windows or xv for X. There are PNG viewers available 
for every graphics-capable modern operating system, so consult 
newsgroups relevant to your particular system.
<P>

</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="buildgd"><H3>How do I build gd?</H3></A>
<P>
In order to build gd, you must first unpack the archive you have
downloaded. If you are not familiar with <code>tar</code> and
<code>gunzip</code> (Unix) or <code>ZIP</code> (Windows), please
consult with an experienced user of your system. Sorry, we cannot
answer questions about basic Internet skills.
<p>
Unpacking the archive will produce a directory called "gd-1.7.2".
<p>
<h4>For Unix</h4>
<code>cd</code> to the 1.7.2 directory. Edit the Makefile with
your preferred text editor and make any necessary changes to the
settings at the top, especially if you want Xpm or TrueType support.
Next, type "make". If you are the system administrator, and you
wish to make the gd library available to other programs, you may 
also wish to type "make install".
<p>
If you get errors, edit the Makefile again, paying special attention
to the INCLUDEDIRS and LIBDIRS settings.
<h4>For Windows, Mac, Et Cetera</h4>
Create a project using your favorite programming environment.
Copy all of the gd files to the project directory. Add <code>gd.c</code>
to your project. Add other source files as appropriate. Learning the
basic skills of creating projects with your chosen C environment
is up to you. 
<P>
You have now built both the gd library and a demonstration program which 
shows off the capabilities of gd. To see it in action, type
"gddemo".
<P>
gddemo should execute without incident, creating the file
demoout.png. (Note there is also a file named demoin.png,
which is provided in the package as part of the demonstration.)
<P>
Display demoout.png in your PNG viewer. The image should
be 128x128 pixels and should contain an image of the
space shuttle with quite a lot of graphical elements drawn
on top of it.
<P>
(If you are missing the demoin.png file, the other items
should appear anyway.)
<P>
Look at demoin.png to see the original space shuttle
image which was scaled and copied into the output image.
<P>
<A NAME="basics"><H3>gd basics: using gd in your program</H3></A>
gd lets you create PNG images on the fly. To use gd in your
program, include the file gd.h, and link with the libgd.a
library produced by "make libgd.a", under Unix. Under other
operating systems you will add gd.c to your own project.
<P>
If you want to use the provided fonts, include
gdfontt.h, gdfonts.h, gdfontmb.h, gdfontl.h and/or gdfontg.h. For
more impressive results, install libttf and use the new 
<a href="#gdImageStringTTF">gdImageStringTTF</a>
function. If you are not using the provided Makefile and/or a 
library-based approach, be sure to include the source modules as well in your
project. (They may be too large for 16-bit memory models,
that is, 16-bit DOS and Windows.)
<P>
Here is a short example program. <strong>(For a more advanced example,
see gddemo.c, included in the distribution. gddemo.c is NOT the same program;
it demonstrates additional features!)</strong>
<P>
<PRE>
/* Bring in gd library functions */
#include "gd.h"

/* Bring in standard I/O so we can output the PNG to a file */

	/* Allocate the image: 64 pixels across by 64 pixels tall */
	im = <A HREF="#gdImageCreate">gdImageCreate</A>(64, 64);

	/* Allocate the color black (red, green and blue all minimum).
		Since this is the first color in a new image, it will
		be the background color. */
	black = <A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">gdImageColorAllocate</A>(im, 0, 0, 0);	

	/* Allocate the color white (red, green and blue all maximum). */
	white = <A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">gdImageColorAllocate</A>(im, 255, 255, 255);	
	
	/* Draw a line from the upper left to the lower right,
		using white color index. */
	<A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>(im, 0, 0, 63, 63, white);	

	/* Open a file for writing. "wb" means "write binary", important
		under MSDOS, harmless under Unix. */
	out = fopen("test.png", "wb");

	/* Output the image to the disk file. */
	<A HREF="#gdImagePng">gdImagePng</A>(im, out);	

	/* Close the file. */
	fclose(out);

	/* Destroy the image in memory. */
	<A HREF="#gdImageDestroy">gdImageDestroy</A>(im);
}
</PRE>
When executed, this program creates an image, allocates
two colors (the first color allocated becomes the background
color), draws a diagonal line (note that 0, 0 is the upper
left corner), writes the image to a PNG file, and
destroys the image.
<P>
The above example program should
give you an idea of how the package works.
gd provides many additional functions, which are listed
in the following reference chapters, complete with code
snippets demonstrating each. There is also an
<A HREF="#index">alphabetical index</A>.
<H3><A NAME="webpng">Webpng: a more powerful gd example</A></H3>
Webpng is a simple utility program to manipulate PNGs from the
command line. It is written for Unix and similar command-line
systems, but should be easily adapted for other environments.
Webpng allows you to set transparency and interlacing and
output interesting information about the PNG in question.
<P>
webpng.c is provided in the distribution. Unix users can
simply type "make webpng" to compile the program. Type
"webpng" with no arguments to see the available options.

A "brush" is an image used to draw wide, shaped strokes in another image. Just

setting the transparent color index of the brush image with

gdImageSetBrush is used to specify the brush to be used in a

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
It is often desirable to draw dashed lines, dotted lines, and other
variations on a broken line. gdImageSetStyle can be used to set
any desired series of colors, including a special color that
leaves the background intact, to be repeated during the drawing
of a line.
<P>
To use gdImageSetStyle, create an array of integers and assign
them the desired series of color values to be repeated.
You can assign the special color value <A HREF="#gdTransparent">
gdTransparent</A> to indicate that the existing color should
be left unchanged for that particular pixel (allowing a dashed
line to be attractively drawn over an existing image).
<P>
Then, to draw a line using the style, use the normal
<A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function with the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>.
<P>
As of <A HREF="#whatsnew1.1.1">version 1.1.1</A>, the style
array is copied when you set the style, so you need not
be concerned with keeping the array around indefinitely.
This should not break existing code that assumes styles
are not copied.
<P>
You can also combine styles and brushes to draw the brush
image at intervals instead of in a continuous stroke.
When creating a style for use with a brush, the
style values are interpreted differently: zero (0) indicates
pixels at which the brush should not be drawn, while one (1)
indicates pixels at which the brush should be drawn.
To draw a styled, brushed line, you must use the
special color value <A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">
gdStyledBrushed</A>. For an example of this feature
in use, see gddemo.c (provided in the distribution).

<STRONG>(FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
gdImageStringTTF is draws a string of anti-aliased characters on the image
using the 
<A HREF=http://www.freetype.org/>FreeType</A>
library to print from user-supplied TrueType fonts.
<strong>We do not provide TrueType fonts. Obtaining them
is entirely up to you.</strong>
The string is anti-aliased, meaning that there should be less "jaggies."
The fontname is the full pathname to a TrueType font file.
The string may be arbitrarily scaled (ptsize) and rotated (angle in radians).
<p>
The user-supplied int brect[8] array is filled on return from gdImageStringTTF
with the 8 elements representing the 4 corner coordinates of the
bounding rectangle.
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" >0</TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

upper left corner, Y position</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
The points are relative to the text regardless of the angle, so "upper left"
means in the top left-hand corner seeing the text horizontally.
<p>
Use a NULL gdImagePtr to get the bounding rectangle without rendering.
This is a relatively cheap operation if followed by a rendering of the same
string, because of the caching of the partial rendering during bounding
rectangle calculation.
<p>
The string is rendered in the color indicated by the gf color index.
Use the negative of the desired color index to disable anti-aliasing.
<p>
The string may contain UTF-8 sequences like: "&amp;#192;"
<p>
gdImageStringTTF will return a null char* on success, or an error
string on failure.

region will be copied. The <code>src</code> argument is the source
image from which the region is copied. The <code>dstX</code>
and <code>dstY</code> arguments specify the point in the destination
image to which the region will be copied. The <code>srcX</code>
and <code>srcY</code> arguments specify the upper left corner
of the region in the source image. The <code>dstW</code>
and <code>dstH</code> arguments specify the width and height
of the destination region. The <code>srcW</code>
and <code>srcH</code> arguments specify the width and height
of the source region and can differ from the destination size,
allowing a region to be scaled during the copying process.
<P>
When you copy a region from one location in an image to another
location in the same image, gdImageCopy will perform as expected
unless the regions overlap, in which case the result is
unpredictable. If this presents a problem, create a scratch image
in which to keep intermediate results.
<P>
<strong>Important note on copying between images:</strong> since images
do not necessarily have the same color tables, pixels are not simply set
to the same color index values to copy them. gdImageCopy will attempt
to find an identical RGB value in the destination image for
each pixel in the copied portion of the source image by
invoking <A HREF="#gdImageColorExact">gdImageColorExact</A>. If
such a value is not found, gdImageCopy will attempt to
allocate colors as needed using <A HREF="#gdImageColorAllocate">
gdImageColorAllocate</A>. If both of these methods fail,
gdImageCopy will invoke <A HREF="#gdImageColorClosest">
gdImageColorClosest</A> to find the color in the destination
image which most closely approximates the color of the
pixel being copied.

<DD>
gdImageCopyMerge is almost identical to <a href=#gdImageCopy>gdImageCopy</a>, except that
it 'merges' the two images by an amount specified in the last parameter. If the last
parameter is 100, then it will function identically to gdImageCopy - the source image replaces
the pixels in the destination.
<p>
If, however, the <strong>pct</strong> parameter is less than 100, then the two images are merged.
With pct = 0, no action is taken.
<p>This feature is most useful to 'highlight' sections of an image by merging a solid color with

<DT><A NAME="gdImageCompare">int gdImageCompare(gdImagePtr im1, gdImagePtr im2)
<STRONG> (FUNCTION)</STRONG>
<DD>
gdImageCompare returns a bitmap indicating if the two images are different. The members of the 
bitmap are defined in gd.h, but the most important is GD_CMP_IMAGE, which indicated that the images
will actually appear different when displayed. Other, less important, differences relate to pallette
entries. Any difference in the transparent colour is assumed to make images display differently,
even if the transparent colour is not used.

<DT><A NAME="gdImageInterlace">gdImageInterlace(gdImagePtr im, int interlace)</A> <strong>(FUNCTION)</strong>
<DD>
gdImageInterlace is used to determine whether an image should be stored
in a linear fashion, in which lines will appear on the display from
first to last, or in an interlaced fashion, in which the image
will "fade in" over several passes. By default, images are not
interlaced.
<P>
A nonzero value for the interlace argument turns on interlace;
a zero value turns it off. Note that interlace has no effect
on other functions, and has no meaning unless you save the
image in PNG format; the gd and xbm formats do not support
interlace.
<P>
When a PNG is loaded with <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromPng">gdImageCreateFromPng
</A>, interlace will be set according to the setting in the PNG file.
<P>
Note that many PNG viewers and web browsers do <em>not</em> support
interlace. However, the interlaced PNG should still display; it
will simply appear all at once, just as other images do.

<H3><A NAME="constants">Constants</A></H3>
<DL>
<DT><A NAME="gdBrushed">gdBrushed</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdBrushed is used as the color, the brush
image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetBrush">gdImageSetBrush</A>
is drawn in place of each pixel of the line (the brush is
usually larger than one pixel, creating the effect
of a wide paintbrush). See also
<A HREF="#gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A> for a way
to draw broken lines with a series of distinct copies of an image.
<DT><A NAME="gdMaxColors"><code>gdMaxColors</code><strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
The constant 256. This is the maximum number of colors in a PNG file
according to the PNG standard, and is also the maximum number of
colors in a gd image.
<DT><A NAME="gdStyled">gdStyled</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdStyled is used as the color, the colors of the pixels are
drawn successively from the style that has been
set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>.
If the color of a pixel is equal to
<A HREF="#gdTransparent">gdTransparent</A>, that pixel
is not altered. (This mechanism is completely unrelated
to the "transparent color" of the image itself; see
<A HREF="#gdImageColorTransparent">gdImageColorTransparent</A>
gdImageColorTransparent for that mechanism.) See also
<A NAME="#gdStyledBrushed"> gdStyledBrushed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a color when invoking a line-drawing
function such as <A HREF="#gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A>
or <A HREF="#gdImageRectangle">gdImageRectangle</A>.
When gdStyledBrushed is used as the color, the brush
image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetBrush">gdImageSetBrush</A>
is drawn at each pixel of the line, providing that the
style set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>
contains a nonzero value (OR gdTransparent, which
does not equal zero but is supported for consistency)
for the current pixel. (Pixels are drawn successively from the style as the
line is drawn, returning to the beginning when the
available pixels in the style are exhausted.) Note that
this differs from the behavior of <A HREF="#gdStyled">gdStyled</A>,
in which the values in the style are used as actual
pixel colors, except for gdTransparent.
<DT><A NAME="gdDashSize">gdDashSize</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
The length of a dash in a dashed line. Defined to be 4 for
backwards compatibility with programs that use
<A NAME="gdImageDashedLine">gdImageDashedLine</A>. New
programs should use <A NAME="gdImageSetStyle">
gdImageSetStyle</A> and call the standard
<A NAME="gdImageLine">gdImageLine</A> function
with the special "color" <A NAME="gdStyled">
gdStyled</A> or <A NAME="gdStyledBrushed">gdStyledBrushed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="gdTiled">gdTiled</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a normal color in <A HREF="#gdImageFilledRectangle">
gdImageFilledRectangle</A>, <A HREF="#gdImageFilledPolygon">
gdImageFilledPolygon</A>,
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A>, and <A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">
gdImageFillToBorder</A>. gdTiled selects a pixel from the
tile image set with <A HREF="#gdImageSetTile">gdImageSetTile</A>
in such a way as to ensure that the filled area will be
tiled with copies of the tile image. See the discussions of
<A HREF="#gdImageFill">gdImageFill</A> and
<A HREF="#gdImageFillToBorder">gdImageFillToBorder</A> for special
restrictions regarding those functions.
<DT><A NAME="gdTransparent">gdTransparent</A> <strong>(CONSTANT)</strong>
<DD>
Used in place of a normal color in a style to be set with
<A HREF="#gdImageSetStyle">gdImageSetStyle</A>.
gdTransparent is <strong>not</strong> the transparent
color index of the image; for that functionality please
see <A HREF="gdImageColorTransparent">gdImageColorTransparent</A>.

<A NAME="gdformat"><H3>About the additional .gd image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the PNG format and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is not a compressed format. Its purpose is solely to
allow very fast loading of images your program needs often in
order to build other images for output. If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed PNG images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd">
gdImageCreateFromGd</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd">gdImageGd</A>,
which read and write .gd format images.

<P>
The program "pngtogd.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.png files to .gd format. I emphasize again that you will not
need to use this format unless you have a need for high-speed loading
of a few frequently-used images in your program.

<A NAME="gd2format"><H3>About the .gd2 image file format</H3></A>
In addition to reading and writing the PNG format and reading the
X Bitmap format, gd has the capability to read and write its
own ".gd2" format. This format is <em>not</em> intended for
general purpose use and should never be used to distribute
images. It is a compressed format allowing pseudo-random access
to large image files. Its purpose is solely to
allow very fast loading of <strong>parts</strong> of images
If you are experiencing
performance problems when loading large, fixed PNG images your
program needs to produce its output images, you may wish
to examine the functions <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd2">
gdImageCreateFromGd2</A>, <A HREF="#gdImageCreateFromGd2Part">
gdImageCreateFromGd2Part</A> and <A HREF="#gdImageGd2">gdImageGd2</A>,
which read and write .gd2 format images.

<P>
The program "pngtogd2.c" is provided as a simple way of converting
.png files to .gd2 format.

<A NAME="gdioctx"><H3>About the gdIOCtx structure</H3></A>
Version 1.5 of GD added a new style of I/O based on an IOCtx
structure (the most up-to-date version can be found in gd_io.h):
<PRE>
typedef struct gdIOCtx {
        int     (*getC)(struct gdIOCtx*);
        int     (*getBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, void*, int);

        void     (*putC)(struct gdIOCtx*, int);
        int     (*putBuf)(struct gdIOCtx*, const void*, int);

        int     (*seek)(struct gdIOCtx*, const int);
        long    (*tell)(struct gdIOCtx*);

        void    (*free)(struct gdIOCtx*);

} gdIOCtx;
</PRE>

Most functions that accepted files in previous versions now also have a
counterpart that accepts an I/O context. These functions have a 'Ctx'
suffix.
<p>
The <xxx>Ctx routines use the function pointers in the I/O context pointed to
by gdIOCtx to perform all I/O. Examples of how to implement an I/O context
can be found in io_file.c (which provides a wrapper for file routines), and
io_dp.c (which implements in-memory storage).
<p>
It is not necessary to implement all functions in an I/O context if you know
that it will only be used in limited cirsumstances. At the time of writing
(Version 1.6.1, July 1999), the known requirements are:
<p>
<Table>
<TR><TD>All</TD><td width=20>&nbsp;</td><TD>Must have 'free',</td></tr>
<TR><TD>Anything that reads from the context</TD><td></td><TD>Must have 'getC' and 'getBuf',</td></tr>
<TR><TD>Anything that writes to the context</TD><td></td><TD>Must have 'putC' and 'putBuf'.</td></tr>
<TR><TD>If gdCreateFromGd2Part is called</td><td></td><TD>Must also have 'seek' and 'tell'.</td></tr>
<TR><TD>If gdImageGd2 is called</td><td></td><TD>Must also have 'seek' and 'tell'.</td></tr>
</Table>
