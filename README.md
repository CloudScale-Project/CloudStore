## Showcase

The showcase is e-commerce web application developed by using [TPC-W](http://www.tpc.org/tpcw/) standard and it is used to validate the tools that were developed during project. Application was developed in Java Springframework and you can find its source code in [application](tree/master/application) directory. 

We also developed [deployment scripts](tree/master/deployment-scripts) to deploy showcase on Amazon Web Services public cloud and on OpenStack private cloud. In order to load test application we developed [distributed JMeter](tree/master/distributed-jmeter) application which helps us deploying distributed JMeter on Amazon Web Services or on OpenStack.

In this repository you will also find the [response generator](tree/master/response-generator) application which we use to simulate the payment gateway of showcase application.
