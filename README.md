## Showcase

The showcase is e-commerce web application developed by using [TPC-W](http://www.tpc.org/tpcw/) standard and it is used to validate the tools that were developed during project. Application was developed in Java Springframework and you can find its source code in [application](https://github.com/CloudScale-Project/Showcase) directory. 

We also developed [deployment scripts](https://github.com/CloudScale-Project/Deployment-Scripts) to deploy showcase on Amazon Web Services public cloud and on OpenStack private cloud. In order to load test application we developed [distributed JMeter](https://github.com/CloudScale-Project/Distributed-Jmeter) application which helps us deploying distributed JMeter on Amazon Web Services or on OpenStack.

In this repository you will also find the [response generator](https://github.com/CloudScale-Project/Response-Generator) application which we use to simulate the payment gateway of showcase application.
