{"name":"Showcase","tagline":"For showcasing the utility of the CloudScale Environment tools and the CloudScale Method, we decided to create a fictitious company with an application that we will drive from a mock-up state to a fully scalable and cost-effective version using the CloudScale project results as tools to achieve this goal easily and efficiently. To that end we took the existing TPC-W definition of an electronic commerce composed of a detailed requirements definitions as well as benchmarking metrics, and which has a legacy monolithic implementation. The progress of the implementation will be divided into three incremental phases. Phase 0 is the legacy system, Phase 1 a modernized version using current technologies for scalability, Phase 2 will provide with a fully and elastically scalable implementation, and the Phase 3 will be focused in the reduction of the operational costs of the entire system. For a full description of the requirements evolution see the Scalability Storyline.","body":"CloudScale project\r\n==================\r\n\r\nHere you will find showcase, deployment scripts for showcase and Django application for distributed JMeter which runs on Amazon Web Services.\r\n\r\nIn each folder you have more specific instructions on how to use each software.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
